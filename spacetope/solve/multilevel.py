"""Cores-first multi-level assembly (MANSION / Rodrigues discipline).

Shaft briefs (M7): each stair or lift is one tall box, placed once while assembling its first served level
and passed unchanged as a fixed box to every other level it serves; corridors and rooms on each level are
assembled around the shafts present there.
Legacy briefs: per-floor stair and lift members are copied to every level at the same footprint.
Each upper level gets a stacking bonus for wall planes aligned with the level below, inside the shared envelope."""
