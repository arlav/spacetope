# Algorithm survey — assembling a tolerant space list into a 3D cell complex

Survey date 2026-09-13 (~35 searches). Suitability score 1–5 is for **spacetope's** need: exact face-sharing boxes, ±10–15 % dimensional tolerance, adjacency/access requirements, corridors + stairs/elevators, multi-level, K options for an architect, verifiable in topologicpy. `(bk)` = background knowledge, not a fetched source.

Columns: **Adj** = how adjacency requirements are handled · **Tol** = how dimensional tolerance is handled · **Exact** = yields exact face sharing (Y), only after snapping (S), or no (N).

## G. Graph-matching / assembly formulations for wall-node ↔ wall-node connection

| # | Formulation | Assessment | Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Bipartite matching / Hungarian on wall-face compatibility cost | A matching is local; global realisability (cycles must close geometrically) is not guaranteed. Use only as heuristic scorer / door-to-corridor assignment | 2 |
| G2 | **CSP over face pairings with dimensional compatibility**: per room pair a relation ∈ {left, right, front, back, above, below, none}; consistency = interval algebra per axis; required adjacencies; envelope; then LP for sizes | Exactly the sequence-pair / TCG / MIQP view; CP-SAT handles 50–100 rooms with hierarchy | **5** |
| G3 | Jigsaw / tiling with tolerant edges (deformable templates, Roominoes) | Good when rooms repeat | 3 |
| G4 | Wave Function Collapse (Gumin 2016), Model Synthesis (Merrell 2007/09; Punch-Out 2025) | Grid tiles with local adjacency rules; great for cores/corridor modules on a structural grid, poor for heterogeneous room sizes | 3 (cores/circulation) |
| G5 | **Beam search / MCTS over partial assemblies**: each step = (free wall face, unplaced room, offset); incremental interval validity; final topologicpy check; beam width = diversity = options | Native to our wall-node metaphor; natural host for a learned policy/value later | **4** |
| G6 | SAT/SMT (Z3): dungeon layouts with linear constraints (FDG 2020), ORCSolver (2002.09925) | Great for feasibility and enumerating distinct topologies with blocking clauses; weaker than CP-SAT for quadratic objectives | 4 |

## H. Metrics for ranking options

1. **Adjacency/access satisfaction** — fraction of required pairs sharing a face with overlap ≥ door (0.9 × 2.1 m); from `NonManifoldFaces` + realised graph.
2. **Dimensional deviation** — Σ |d − d*| / d* over w, l, h; aspect penalties.
3. **Compactness** — external surface ÷ volume; external vertical face area (`Decompose`).
4. **Circulation efficiency** — circulation area ÷ net area; mean shortest path on the dual graph weighted by centroid distance; dead-end count.
5. **Space-syntax integration / depth** on the dual graph (networkx closeness; SSPT-style public-space dominance).
6. **Daylight proxy** — fraction of habitable rooms with ≥ 1 external vertical face; external face area per level.
7. **Structural alignment** — fraction of internal vertical face planes on level k coincident with a plane on level k−1 (MANSION treats as hard).
8. **Envelope fit** — union volume ÷ envelope volume; max protrusion.
9. **Vertical connectivity** — every level's dual graph reachable through stair/elevator cells; cores stacked (shared horizontal faces).

Multi-objective ranking: Pareto front (pymoo/DEAP) or architect-weighted sum (Bahrehmand interactive weights).

## Ranked shortlist and selection

1. **Relational CP-SAT model with tolerance bounds** (C6 formulation on C11 tooling) — integer mm sizes in the tolerance band, Boolean adjacency with door-overlap, corridor as elongated soft space, `AddNoOverlap2D` per level, K diverse solutions via blocking clauses. Exact by construction. **Selected: the exact engine (M4).**
2. **Rectangular dual + LP dimensioning** (A5) — enumerates all topologically distinct plans when the brief supplies a rich adjacency graph; corridor node repairs non-PTP graphs. **Selected as optional enumerator for rich briefs (M4, stretch).**
3. **Sequence pair / slicing tree + SA with soft sizing** (E2/E3) — the encoding that scales to 100–300 rooms. **Selected as the encoding vocabulary; SA variant deferred until CP-SAT hits its size limit.**
4. **Layered 3D: cores first, then per-level solve, cross-level alignment as soft term** (B5, C2, D5) — **Selected as the multi-level discipline (M3).**
5. **Beam search over incremental wall-to-wall attachment** (G5) — spacetope's native mechanism, gives options quickly, becomes the ML host. **Selected as the first generator (M2).**
6. **Squarified treemap / k-d subdivision seed** (B3, B7, C10) — sub-second baseline and initialiser. **Selected as baseline in M2.**
7. **Magnetizing corridor spine** (C9) — **Selected as the corridor heuristic inside beam search (M2).**
8. **Z3 feasibility enumeration** (G6) — cross-check only; not scheduled.

Rejected for now: QAP grids (A1), packing heuristics (E1), 2D residential generative models (D2) as generators, WFC (G4) except possibly for core placement on a structural grid, true 3D cube packing.

**Data-driven later**: CP/LP layer remains the verifier; ML replaces the proposal layer — a GNN/diffusion model conditioned on the brief graph emitting relation sets (sequence pairs / contact-edge sets) or scoring beam-search moves (Graph2Plan / HouseDiffusion / Building-GAN style); training data = spacetope's own verified options exported via `Graph.ExportToCSV`, plus real buildings' adjacency graphs from an IFC corpus via `Graph.ByTopology`; SSPT-style RL post-training with section H metrics as verifiable rewards.

**Python libraries**: `ortools` (CP-SAT, LP), `networkx` (planarity, embeddings, duals, space syntax), `shapely`, `scipy.optimize`/`cvxpy`, `topologicpy`, `squarify`, `z3-solver`, `pymoo`/`DEAP`, `rectpack`/`py3dbp` (envelope sanity only), `torch_geometric` (later).
